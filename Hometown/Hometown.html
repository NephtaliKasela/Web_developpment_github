                <p class="parag01">Lubumbashi is, according to estimates, the second largest city in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in terms of population and economic importance. It is the capital of the former province of Katanga (temporarily Shaba under the reign of Mobutu) until 2015 then that of the province of Haut-Katanga from 2015.
        
                    Lubumbashi is sometimes nicknamed the “ copper capital  ” 1 .
                    
                    Founded in 1910 by the Belgians, under the name of Elisabethville or Elisabethstad (after Elisabeth in Bavaria , who became Queen of the Belgians) 1 , often abbreviated as "E'ville" 2 , the city was renamed Lubumbashi in 1966 . It was also the capital of the short-lived self-proclaimed state of Katanga (1960-1963), born under the leadership of Moïse Tshombe .
                    
                    It is the headquarters of several large Congolese companies, or companies with foreign capital, including the National Railway Company of Congo , Gécamines , Rwuashi Mining and KICC (Metorex Group companies), Anvil Mining sprl (Mawson West RDC), Société de Treatment of the Terril de Lubumbashi (STL), Tenke Fungurume Mining (Freeport MacMoran), Phelps Dodges RDC, or the George Forrest group [ref. necessary] .
                    
                    Kasapa prison is located north of Lubumbashi, currently not far from new housing estates allocated to their new buyers. This prison is listed among the largest prisons in the country, with a large prison population. Together with the Central Prison of Makala in Kinshasa and that of Buluwo in Likasi , they are reputed to be the most secure in the Democratic Republic of Congo</p>
